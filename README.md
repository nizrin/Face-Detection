🚀 Face Detection using OpenCV 

🔍 About the Project:
  This project focuses on face detection using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier. 
 I implemented face detection in both images and videos by drawing bounding boxes around detected faces.

📌 What this code does:

 ✅ Loads an image using OpenCV and detects faces.
 
 ✅ Converts BGR to RGB for proper visualization with matplotlib.
 
 ✅ Uses Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in images.
 
 ✅ Processes a video frame by frame, applying real-time face detection.
 
 ✅ Draws a red rectangle around detected faces.
 
 ✅ Closes the video when the user presses 'q'.

🔗 Key Libraries Used: OpenCV, Matplotlib


The project helped me understand computer vision fundamentals in real-time applications.
